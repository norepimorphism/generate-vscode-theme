# VS Code Theme Generator

A simple command-line tool to generate an ugly VS Code color theme.

## Usage

Run `cargo run` in this directory. If successful, the `/package` directory will afterward contain a functional theme extension. To test it, press the <kbd>F5</kbd> key while viewing `/package/themes/norepi-color-theme.json` in VS Code; a new VS Code window should open with the theme enabled.
